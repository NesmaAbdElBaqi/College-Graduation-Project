# Child Emotions Classification Project
# College-Graduation-Project

In this section we will give the full picture of the project.
Because caring for children early is a future investment, our project serves them
The project is specially designed to recognize children's faces specifically and identify their different facial expressions to infer their simple feelings, and to closely identify their personalities so that we can direct them later, put them in their right places and focus on their interests.
So, the goal of the project is to create an algorithm capable of detecting children's feelings in a video clip, after it has been identified.
